# Software Development for Mobile Platforms

This course addresses the concepts, techniques, and tools required for developing applications within software frameworks for mobile platforms. Topics include the concepts and principles underlying software frameworks, the design and implementation of client-server applications, principles of user experience design for frameworks, the design and implementation of client-server applications, principles of user experience design for mobile applications, and key concepts in reliability, privacy, security and safety critical systems. Practical work will involve the design, implementation and testing of a range of mobile applications.

### Course content
This course involves learning and using at least two different major frameworks used in software development for mobile platforms, writing reports on the mobile UX, and learning about and developing Internet of Things technologies. The course is internally assessed through a number of major assignments/projects that can be done either individually or in small groups.

### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Construct software applications within large software frameworks.
2. Independently learn and use new software frameworks.
3. Design, implement, and test applications for a mobile platform.
4. Apply user experience principles to the design, implementation, and evaluation of user interfaces for mobile applications.
5. Articulate and apply the key principles of privacy, security and safety critical systems in the context of mobile applications.
