# App Description

The assignment was to describe a mobile application that you wish to create.

This included:
- Estimating the time to create
  - Including the time it would take to learn the framework/language.
- Describing in detail the components
  - How they would be used
  - Visual details (like colour)

I chose to create an organiser app for students. The three events (homework, class, or social) would have different information needed and would be displayed in different ways to help users comprehend what they need to be doing. Finally, to encourage users, I wanted to include a reward function after a completing a certain amount of homework.
